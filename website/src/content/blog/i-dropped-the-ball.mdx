# I dropped the ball

Well, not completely. As of today, I have missed my goal of a weekly blog post.

I had seen this coming last Thursday but last night, while trying to throw together a tutorial on theming Network Managers nmtui tool, I made the decision to knowingly miss this goal.

Over the last week I have made changes elsewhere in the project. I set up the analytics and some basic SEO services. I added breadcrumbs and learned a lot about accessibility. What I didn't do, was realise how much work a good tutorial is.

I slacked on my research and was working towards a rambling, plain text tutorial outlining my initial slap-dash method. No images, an incomplete solution and badly presented information.

I am planning to finish this tutorial either today or tomorrow, and then keep up with the weekly blog posts from this point forward.

My priority at the moment is keeping the project present in my mind and making small steps towards a bigger goal.
