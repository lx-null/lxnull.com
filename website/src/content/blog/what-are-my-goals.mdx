# What are my goals?

I've started this website because I have a few goals I would like to achieve in the short term. Most of these goals are web development focused but they all tie into a larger, long term goal: overcoming my ADHD.

My 3 year journey in my web dev career so far has been hectic, and my personal repositories are a collection of half baked, half finished and sometimes only half started projects.

Burying my head in the sand with excuses of burnout and a lost passion for web development, I've let myself lose discipline and focus. I'm not learning any more and the only output I do deliver is at work, which isn't super fulfilling.

This website is an opportunity to change that. A small and easy project with lots of avenues for expression and learning, broken down into simple clear milestones.

I thought I should document my goals for the first milestone here, to try and hold myself accountable.

My goals are:
- Having a fast, accessible website that follows best practises
- Making a blog post every week until the end of 2024 
- Adding a couple of small tools as fun side projects

My deadline for these is 2025, which is quite relaxed. I'm hoping it gives me the chance to really have fun with the blog and tools side of things, whilst honing my web development skills along the way.
